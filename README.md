# Project-1-tic-tac-toe

# Description

This project is a small game you can play with your friends or yourself. The project is a simple tictactoe game designed for quick and easy fun. The players are trying to get their character (either 'X' or 'O') to connect in 3 row on the board.I completed the project around 5:00pm 03/04/2023.

I deployed the project on GITHUB and login information isn't required as the project repo is public.

# Acess the code
To access the code go to the link below where you can access the files and you can clone the repo and look at the code. To see the HTML code it is name index.html. The css is the style.css and the javascript is the script.js.

# Timeframe and working team
 This was a solo group project that I was given 5 days to complete.

# Technologies 
The first technology I used was html to setup the front end of the pages. This is also mostly what you will see and it connects the three pages of technologies together. It sets up the header with the <h1> tag and the tabs in <div> so I can start prgramming the game along with the reset button in the <button> tag and I place the in classes so I can access them. I also added the google fonts link.

The second technology I used was the CSS. CSS is used to style the page since html looks boring. I used the CSS to arranged the tabs in the table <div> and changed the bacground colour. I also style the reset button with the css. So the css was used for the front end.

The last technology I used was Java script the was used for the front end interaction such as the tabs changing from 'X' to 'O' and did the using a queryselector to manipulate the DOM. Using the Java script I set the win conditions and also called the tag classes and id's with the variable. Most of the animation is also done by the Java script.

# Brief
Without a starter codebase, create a web application from scratch.
Make use of your programming knowledge to figure out the rules of a straightforward game like tic tac toe.
Split your application's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Create an application in accordance with guidelines provided by someone else.
Create a dynamic game where two players can engage in competition from the same computer.
Create a README.md file to provide a description of your software to the public.


# Requirements
Display a gaming board rendered in the browser
Alternate turning between X and O. (or whichever markers you select)
If a player receives three consecutive victories, indicate which side won visually; if neither player wins, indicate a draw.

Add distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principals.
Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
Launch your game online so that everyone can play it.
Semantic markup is used in HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
Having code that is properly structured and commented
